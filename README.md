## Implementation
The team is separated into mechanical and electronic parts to implement the project. Mechanical part is required to fabricate the kart frame which is able to load and move around smoothly. Electronic part needs to design the program which is used to control the motors. And this record is based on the electronic part, and focusing on STM and ROS programming. (details in report)
